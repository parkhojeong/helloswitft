1) computer basic structure and execution
cpu <-> ram <-> disk
program is loaded into memory from disk

1. program is stored in disk. when program is executed, it is loaded into memory
2. cpu can handle one thing
3. code is translated to machine code for cpu
4. cpu execute code in memory
5. cpu can access memory 

* memory structure
1. code: all or part of program is loaded
2. data: global variable/type(static/class) variable
- common shared data
- during app is executed, these are immutable 
3. heap: dynamic assignment
- developer must manage carefully
4. stack: temporary space for function execution
- automatically managed

- insight: efficient memory structure(design) for maximized speed and optimized condition by data type

* summary
1. cpu, memory, disk are basic structure(von neumann architecture)
2. developer have to know memory structure
3. process is executed with code area and data area(data, heap, stack)
4. memory area is managed by os
