* Part1 - variable and constant
1) variable(mutable)
note: program execution first stage, data is stored in memory
- grammar
```swift
var a = 3
var x = 1, y = 2
```
- naming convention: starting with the lower case
- string interpolation
```swift
var name = "John"
print("hello \(name)")
```

2) constant(immutable)
```swift
let a = 3
```
