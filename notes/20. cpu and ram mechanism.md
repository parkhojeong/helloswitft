cpu
- control unit
  - registers
  - program counter
  - instruction decodor
- arhithmatic unit
  - arhithmatic logical unit
  - acumulator

ram
- code
- data
- heap
- stack

ram
- system s/w(os): cpu/memory/display/sound card/mouse/keyboard/etc
- application s/w
rom
1) power of self testing
2) rom-bios: basic i/o activation
3) boot loader: load os

mechine code(1) - (1)assembly language - high level language
mechine code: cpu can regocnize and execute
assembly language: easier to read and write, more human readable
high level language: more abstract, human readable
compile: high level language -> machine code

* summary
1. cpu has control unit and arhithmatic unit
- use register to store data
2. cpu control unit manage instruction one by one
- if operation is required, delegate to arhithmatic unit
3. os control and manage h/w, s/w
4. application process has memory area (code, data, heap, stack)
5. mechine code has 1:1 relationship with assembly language
