* bit representation
- most significant bit: sign bit
- least significant bit

0b 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 = 1

* sign and absolute value approach
-1 = 0b 1 0 0 0  0 0 0 1
- it does not help calculation

* two's complement
0b 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 1 (0b 0000 0001)
0b 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 0 (one's complement of 0b 0000 0001)
0b 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 (+1) (two's complement of 0b 0000 0001)

  0b 0000 0001
+ 0b 1111 1111
+ 0b 1 0000 0000 (1 is wasted)

* insight
- original value + two's complement = 0

* summary
1. for negative number, msb is used to represent sign
2. two's complement is used to represent negative number
3. original value + two's complement = 0
- it makes calculation faster
